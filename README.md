## **Number-Plate-Detection**

### **Overview**

This project involves creating a web-based application to detect license plates on vehicles in Indonesia. The detection system is built using a custom dataset collected from real-world environments. The dataset was captured using a Canon EOS M10 camera and is confidential, so it cannot be disclosed.

### **Features**
- **License Plate Detection**: Accurately detects and highlights license plates on vehicles in images.
- **Web-Based Interface**: The application is accessible via a simple, user-friendly interface built with Streamlit.

### **Tools & Technologies**
- **YOLOv8**: Utilized for the detection model, providing high accuracy in real-time detection.
- **OCR**: Integrated for recognizing and extracting text from detected license plates (bounding box).
- **Streamlit**: Framework used to create the web interface for the application.
- **Canon EOS M10**: Used to capture the dataset for training the model.

### **How to Use**
1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine.
2. **Install the required dependencies.**
3. **Run the Streamlit application** using the following command:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
4. **Upload an image, and the model will detect and display the license plate(s).

## **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project was captured on the roads of Indonesia using a Canon EOS M10 camera. Due to confidentiality agreements, the dataset cannot be shared publicly.

## **Future Improvements**
Enhance the model's accuracy with a larger and more diverse dataset.
Implement support for video input for real-time license plate detection.
