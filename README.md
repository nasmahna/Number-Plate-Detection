**Number-Plate-Detection**
###**Overview**
This project involves creating a web-based application to detect license plates on vehicles in Indonesia. The detection system is built using a custom dataset collected from real-world environments. The dataset was captured using a Canon EOS M10 camera and is confidential, so it cannot be disclosed.

###**Features**
License Plate Detection: Accurately detects and highlights license plates on vehicles in images.
Web-Based Interface: The application is accessible via a simple, user-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
Tools & Technologies
YOLOv9: Utilized for the detection model, providing high accuracy in real-time detection.
Streamlit: Framework used to create the web interface for the application.
Canon EOS M10: Used to capture the dataset for training the model.

###**How to Use**
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the Streamlit application using the following command:
bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
4. Upload an image, and the model will detect and display the license plate(s).

###**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project was captured on the roads of Indonesia using a Canon EOS M10 camera. Due to confidentiality agreements, the dataset cannot be shared publicly.

###**Future Improvements**
Enhance the model's accuracy with a larger and more diverse dataset.
Implement support for video input for real-time license plate detection.
